Tweetdeck
========

*REALLY* basic electron app. It opens a window with tweetdeck, and opens all links you click on in your default browser. **That's it**.

## Why?
* I use firefox for browsing:
	* I like to keep my cookies separated. 
	* Firefox doesn't support touchscreen scrolling natively.
* I like to have twitter on one half of the screen, and accumulate news stories on the other side.

## Run
To run this program:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/higab85/tweetdeck.git
cd tweetdeck
electron .
```
