Tweetdeck
========

*REALLY* basic electron app. It launches twitter, and opens all links in your default browser. **That's it**.

## Why?
* I use firefox for browsing:
	* I like to keep my cookies separated. 
	* Firefox doesn't support touchscreen scrolling natively.
* I like to have twitter on one half of the screen, and accumulate news stories on the other side.
